          <b>Preface</b>
          <br><br>1. Do you believe in a god?
<br><br>2. Cellular automata is a model of computation that is self-propelling. Simply put, they consist of a grid of cells classified in numerous states and are programmed to automatically compute based on the status of one another according to a predetermined set of rules.
<br><br>3. Determinism, or more namely causal determinism is “the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature.” (Hoefer) Under this idea, our thoughts and decisions are never really ours alone. I am sharing these writings with you, reader, because in many ways, they are also yours.
<br><br>4. I have never thought of myself as someone who participates in religion and worship. To this day I still don't consider myself to be a religious person in the vernacular sense. However, I have also recently began to understand humanity’s current paradigm of thinking as sort of hyper-rational, as to look down on any and all forms of religion, spirituality, metaphysics, and anything else that does not follow the time’s empirical way of thinking. In his <i>Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding </i> Hume concludes: “If we take in our hand any volume [book]; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.” (Hume) Intellectually, I am inclined to agree with him and the current paradigm of thinking. However, I am not happy with my belief; How it tells me that I am essentially a cell.
<br><br>5. When I am talking about art, I am not talking about communication or language. I am talking about poetry. Words just happen to be the medium, not the source. What does your art do then? I don’t entirely know quite yet.
<br><br>6. I ask you, reader, to understand that I am not writing to argue. Do not make the mistake of thinking that my words are criticisms. These writings are simply observations. They are selfish, self-involved, and sad. I am writing in hopes that in doing so, I am inadvertently creating art; That I too am reading my words in hopes that I will learn to see them as such.
