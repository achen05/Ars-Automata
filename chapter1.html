                A. How many people does it take to live?
                Not to be born, but to stay alive?
                Archeology tells us that two are needed: our parents. In prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies, sexual division of labour gave the Homo sapiens an essential organizational advantage over the Neanderthals.
                I can only assume this tendency carried over through generations as humanity continued to evolve.
                Now, to live arguably means more than to simply be alive in a biological sense.
                It means to feel real.
              </p><br>

                B. In recent US history, there has been a dramatic increase nationwide in gay marriages, adoptions, polyamorous relationships, and single parent households.
                The idea of what constitutes a family has been endlessly deconstructed, redefined, and then deconstructed again.
              </p><br>
              <p>
                C. I want to ask then, how many people does it take to live today?
                But really, this question isn't for anyone to answer.
                I want to live. I want to feel real.

                A. Wikipedia tells me that self organization, or spontaneous order, is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initally disordered system.

                  B. My therapist asks me rhetorically: "Well who wouldn't want a caring, supportive, and strong figure in their life?"

                <p>
                  C. I once met up with a man slightly more than double my age at his San Francisco apartment for a sort of 'semi-date'.
                  We're talking on the roof terrace and I remember asking him, rather bluntly: What exactly did he want in meeting me today?
                  I correctly assumed at least part of his answer.
                  In hindsight the question may have come off as rude, but I didn't ask so I could mentally shame him for wanting to have sex with a younger man, presumably me in this case.
                  I asked because I wondered if there were men out there, older gay men in particular, who have what I now call 'son issues.'
                  A sort of 'daddy issues' in reverse.
                  Later, when I Google'd the term, Urban Dictionary confirmed that this idea is indeed a thing.
                  How common, I'm not sure.
                  I guess I just wanted to know if he too felt that there was something missing and sought to fill it.
