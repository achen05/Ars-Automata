                A. Wikipedia tells me that “self organization, or spontaneous order, is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system.” (Wikipedia)

                B. Pharmakon is famous for the fact that it remains undecided as to whether it means cure or poison. But what if the cure is poison? This question leads me to a lesser known third definition of the word: a scapegoat.

                C. Our bodies will tell us what we need. If we listen closely, it will tell us what is healthy, what it hurting, and what is missing. My body will tell me all these things in part to indirectly remind me that really, I am just a body. Simply, that my life is essentially a process of homeostasis. The things our body tells us we need are called symptoms. We don’t like symptoms. We’re always trying to minimize them in any and all forms as if they had a finite amount that could be slowly reduced to nothing. Sometimes, I wonder if what we should really be doing is learning to simply look at these symptoms and nod. To let things fall apart, reorganize, reconstruct only to fall apart again and to watch it all unfold in front of us with popcorn and soda.

                A. I am utterly anxiety ridden. As I am writing this, I have been recommended by both my therapist and physician to begin seeing a psychiatrist; For medication and for a formal diagnosis of my apparent OCD symptoms. I do not like this idea. I especially do not like pills, not because I have trouble swallowing them, but because I have long prided myself on my independence and hate the idea of relying on a pill to achieve a sound state of mind. In reality, this independence eludes me, as I have come to understand that most, if not everything I do is an attempt at reaching for something to depend on. I am reaching for food. I am reaching for love. I am reaching for clarity. I am seeing a psychiatrist in about two weeks from the time of writing this.

                  B. The definition of anxiety is, in part, the definition of uncertainty as one does not experience anxiety without it. At first, it may feel instinctive to go looking for answers, but this is like adding fuel to a fire. What may initially look like water reveals itself to be gasoline.

                  C. On a Facetime call with a friend of mine, she is telling me about her frustration with a particular assignment of hers. One of the classes she had enrolled in this semester is a class taught by the philosopher Tyler Burge. The particular assignment my friend was referring to was to write an essay on Burge’s theory of anti-individualism and its relationship to perception. She tells me the she doesn’t even entirely understand what Burge’s theory is about and is pulling hairs thinking about it. I asked her why she’d enrolled in such a class. Her answer was that, despite her apparent unhappiness, she felt that the class changed the way she looked at things. I can no longer share this attitude with her. In the face of my anxiety, I have learned the hard way that no amount of philosophical inquiry can ever stop me from feeling. One can’t win an argument with the irrational. One cannot answer questions with more questions. I have sadistically drowned myself in the word vomit of some of humanity’s most admired philosophers, from Zizek to Murdoch to Kant. Painfully drinking the Kool-Aid not out of having been persuaded, but wishing that I could have been. I am not seeking truth in the aesthetic, the moral, the economic, or the linguistic; I am seeking anxiety relief. That is my dirty secret.

                  A. When I think of my father, I cannot say that he didn’t love me. Rather, I think of how he was never really here with me.

                    B. In a therapy session I bring up that I've been wallowing in self hatred towards the fact that I happen to only be interested in dating older men. My therapist rhetorically asks me: "Well who wouldn't want a strong, caring, and supportive figure in their life?” I wanted to say that I didn’t, that instead I wanted to be my own. But as much as I can pretend to be, I can’t of course.

                    C. I once met up with a man slightly more than double my age at his San Francisco apartment for a sort of ‘semi-date'. We're talking on the roof terrace and I remember asking him, rather bluntly: What exactly did he want in meeting me today? I correctly assumed at least part of his answer. In hindsight the question may have come off as rude, but I didn't ask so I could mentally shame him for wanting to have sex with a younger man, presumably me in this case. I asked because I wondered if there were men out there, older gay men in particular, who have what I now call 'son issues.’ A sort of 'daddy issues' in reverse. Later, when I Google'd the term, Urban Dictionary confirmed that this idea is indeed a thing. How common, I'm not sure. I guess I just wanted to know if he too felt that there was something missing and sought to fill it.

                    A. Many of my friends are currently attending a variety of prestigious colleges. I am happy for them, genuinely. However, I’d be lying if I said that this fact hadn’t planted within me a deep resentment towards myself. This resentment fueled me endlessly, towards my goals and towards my unhappiness. Both. But how can it be both?

                    <p>
                      B. The words "absolute fuck-up” have never sounded so clearly to me than when I was taking a gap year before college. I always imagined the words being shouted at me by someone like J.K. Simmons’ character in <i>Whiplash</i>: viscerally anxiety inducing to an almost sadistic degree. When RISD accepted me into the class of 2024, I couldn’t afford attending without taking on loans in the hundreds of thousands. I didn’t go. At this point, prestige becomes a lifeline, a drug, and as long as I am obsessed with it, a whip.

                    <p>
                      C.  My solution then, was to begin playing a game I jokingly called “Collecting the Ivy League” in which I would date men who had graduated from prestigious universities. I met men who had graduated from Harvard, Yale, UPenn, and entertained the idea of meeting others who graduated from similarly ranked universities; Unaware, or perhaps in denial of the idea that I was essentially commodifying myself for these men as if doing so would metaphysically transfer their perceived prestige to me. Perhaps it was a sort of transaction, a commodification of each other from both ends in which I always lost.
